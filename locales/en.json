  "hero_opis": "A mechanical assembly that, once tightened, spontaneously begins to accelerate - without external input. This is not an illusion, but a consequence of ingeniously designed geometry and a kinematic trap. This discovery does not disprove Newton's laws; on the contrary, it confirms their validity in new mechanical systems. Welcome to a world where the tension force of the chain becomes kinematically trapped. The necessary balance of torques is achieved by constant angular acceleration - as the only possible physical response.",

  "discovery_1": "Kinematic Lock: The specific arrangement of gears and chains creates a closed loop in which the tension force becomes permanently trapped – there is no path for relaxation.",
  "discovery_2": "Built-in Tension as the Driver: A constant force F0 cannot dissipate, so the only possible response of the system is – continuous acceleration. Its magnitude is determined by geometry, not by energy input.",
  "discovery_3": "Negative Dynamic Contribution of the Carrier: The carrier behaves as an energy source: instead of decelerating the system, it accelerates in the opposite direction, delivering energy to the rest of the mechanism.",
  "discovery_4": "Dynamic Inertial Equilibrium: The static reaction of the fixed sun gear is balanced solely by the inertial forces of the accelerating masses – an equilibrium that sustains itself through acceleration.",
  "discovery_5": "Experimental Proof: In the mixed mode (simultaneous action of built-in tension and external torques), a measurable interaction term appears in the power balance – a direct confirmation of the phenomenon.",
